# Neural Networks and Zhiwei Learning

This repository contains the learning code I use and play around for neural networks and deep learning. I use this 
repository to record my learning process.

The learning resources are from several sources, including but not limited to:

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) 
* [Andrej Karpathy's educational projects](https://github.com/karpathy)
* Coursera's courses, [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) and [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
* [PyTorch's examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)
* [PyTorch's tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials)
* [Some Kaggle's competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/lzwjava)

## Work I do 

* For some projects, I carefully analyze the code and print the variables to understand what is going on.
* For some projects, I try to remove the implementation and just leave the function signature and try to implement it.
* For the Coursera's courses, I do the most of the homework, and sometimes find the help of others' code.
* For the kaggle's competitions I attended, I will try a lot of ways to solve first, and sometimes find the help of 
others' code.
